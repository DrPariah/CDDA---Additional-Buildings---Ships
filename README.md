This is forked from the original Oa's Additional Buildings mod, a later iteration with cruise and cargo ships. All the other building types appear to have been mainlined, so I focused only on the ships. I managed to get them working with the pre-Nested Containers experimental builds, and there is a separate file for the 0.E Stable version.

Cargo Ships are overmap specials, much like a shipwreck. Possible they may well BE the shipwrecks that got mainlined as overmap specials, I'm not sure.
Expect Razorclaws and other aquatic threats around them. 
Cruise Ships don't seem to have an equivalent in the main game. They're VERY large, with cluttered decks and tight corridors (making acidic zombies and smokers a serious threat). There is a "Cruise of the Dead" scenario that lets you start out on one. Good luck. You'll need it.

Note that some of the ships get odd terrain effects around them sometimes (partial land tiles in the water). Not sure why it's doing that, and it's beyond my admittedly limited modding skills to fix.

All credit goes to the original author, I just patched it up.

INSTALLATION:

1. Download file.
2. Extract into your CDDA Mods folder.
3. Die repeatedly on a Cruise Ship from Spitter zombies melting your face off.
