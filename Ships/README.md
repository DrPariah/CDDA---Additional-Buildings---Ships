Oa's additional buildings mod

NOTE: This development version of the mod may or may not run; depending on what is currently being worked on.
Please use the latest released version as that would definitely run.


Current version:

    Adds 19 buildings to the game.

contents:

City buildings/structures:
    
    car dealership
    car showroom
    city dump (small)
    gardening allotment
    internet cafe
    market (small)
    open sewer
    private park
    public art piece
    public space
    sex shop
    tire shop
		
Outer buildings/structures:
    
    fire lookout tower (3 z-levels)
    giant sinkhole (2 z-levels) [currently nixed]
    survivor's bunker (2 z-levels)
    survivor's camp
    regional dump (4x4)
    cargo ship (1x3) (2 z-levels)
    cruise ship (2x4) (3 z-levels)

Scenarios:

    "Last day at the dealership"
      car salesman start in either "Car Dealership" or "Car Showroom"
    "Cruise of the Dead"
      "Cruise Ship" start

Notes: 

    If you wish to prevent any one building from generating,
    find it in either "overmap_specials.json" and set it's '"occurrences":'
    stat to "[0,0]". Alternatively, find the building in "regional_overlay.json"
    and change it's respective "city" stat to zero; (e.g. '"cs_open_sewer": 0,')
		
    Although I have attempted to balance these buildings' (item drops and monster spawns),
    it is difficult to gauge whether or not they are balanced relative to the rest of the game.
		
Feedback welcome
